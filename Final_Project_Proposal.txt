What to do: 
Build a Network File System (NFS) on JOS. We plan to implement this NFS as a
server in user space just like JOS's VFS, of course, with support from kernel.
The NFS will support basic NFS operations including 'lookup', 'mount', 'open',
    'read', 'write', 'remove', 'stat', 'flush', and 'close'. 

What to present:
Multiple computers running JOS can share storage through the above-mentioned NFS
interfaces on network communication. When permission is granted, computer-A
(client) will be able to explore, read, and write files and directories on local
storage of computer-B (server). 

What to challenge:
Implement 'read ahead': read more file blocks from server in advance
Implement 'automounting': client automatically mounts the server's directory
