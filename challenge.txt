LAB 5 Exercise 2: Block cache eviction

	In fs/bc.c, add function bc_reclaim() to evict file blocks.

	Two variables:
	pgfault_cnt: the number of times which bc_pgfault is been called
	threshold  : when eviction reaches to threshold, evict block cache, and set
				 pgfault_cnt back to zero
	
	Go through the bitmap, check which block is being used, if it is accessed in
	page table, then call sys_page_unmap to free corresponding page frame. If
	the dirty bit is set, then flush this block back to disk before call
	sys_page_unmap.

	For more detail, see fs/bc.c

	Test Result:

	Since our file system is very small, set the threshold to be 16. After
	bc_pgfault() has been called for 16 times, bc_reclaim() will work. The
	following is the result of running user/icode.

	env_create pid 00001000
	env_create pid 00001001
	env_create pid 00001002
